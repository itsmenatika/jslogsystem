## What is it?

The purpose of that thing is to allow easy logging from applications while still allowing the use of the console

the logging system allows you to add your own commands via simple API


## how to use

you can use it either with or without typescript. The choice is yours, but i would recommed using typescript, or even as imported thing.
I will also assume that you have git installed, because you're on their website.

### typescript

with typescript you need to run following commands to install (it will compile program again): 
```
cmd
git clone https://github.com/itsmenatika/jslogsystem.git
cd jslogsystem
npm install
tsc
node logSystem.js
```

you can later run it while being in the correct directory by using: ```node logSystem.js```

### without typescript

it will only install that repository without compiling (the repository already has it up to date): 
```
cmd
git clone https://github.com/itsmenatika/jslogsystem.git
cd jslogsystem
npm install
node logSystem.js
```
you can later run it while being in the correct directory by using: ```node logSystem.js```
