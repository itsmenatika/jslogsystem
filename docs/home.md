## how to start?

You need to download [logSystem.ts](../logSystem.ts) if you use typescript or [logSystem.js](../logSystem.js) if not. Then you should place that file somewhere in your project and import it.

From then on, you can write the code.

You can use the minimal code found on [THERE](setup.md).

## The stuff that you may want to use:

[full list](./exp/index.md)

* [keepProcessAlive()](./exp/keepProcessAlive.md) -> It forces the process to continue on running, even though there's no reason for it
